### A bit about me: 
Today, I dream to work with difficult web-projects. For example, like as [figma](https://www.figma.com), [codewars](https://www.codewars.com), [codeacademy](http://www.codecademy.com/), [docs.google](https://docs.google.com) and others, wich don`t only use static web page. I want to be a creater or to participate in creation. I don`t only want to be a consumer. It`s very !important for me!

Tests on the Internet speak that I have A2+ level or B1 level. But I`m not sure about that. I think that I have B1 for reading and audition and A2 for writing and conversation.
